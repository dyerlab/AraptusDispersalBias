## The Data

Loading the data in and playing around with it.  Blah this is cool, I love R.

```{r}
library( tidyverse )
data <- read_csv("data/Araptus_Samples.csv")
summary( data )
```

To determine the names of the data columns.


```{r}
names( data )
```


Make a plot of males vs females in each site.

```{r}
data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point( aes(Females, Males) ) +
  coord_equal() + 
  xlab("Number of Female Beetles") +
  ylab("Number of Male Beetles") + 
  geom_abline( intercept = 0, slope=1, color="red", linetype = 3  ) +
  theme_bw()
```




```{r}
data %>%
  mutate( Ratio = Females/Males ) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point( aes( Suitability, Ratio ) )
```
